# CHANGELOG 03/19/2021

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug where players would spawn with nothing when they leave after dying or they join for the first time.
- Fixed a bug where weapon attachments didn’t save inside of small storage chests.
- Fixed a bug where containers didn’t have items until after the first respawn.
- Fixed a bug where players would spawn before they had completely loaded.
- Fixed a bug where building placements went in the wrong spot once placed.
- Fixed a bug where dropping an item that was in use would break all item use.
- Fixed a bug where dead players would get a rejoin penalty when leaving the game while in combat.
- Fixed a bug where doors would be in the wrong spot when the server restarted while they were opened.
- Fixed a bug where the combat timer was incorrectly set to 30 instead of 60 when actually hitting a player with a bullet. 30 seconds should be the “near-miss” combat timer.
- Fixed a bug where the camera would clip through or partially into objects that were very close to it or your character.
