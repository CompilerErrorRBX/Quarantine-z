## Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug where players would spawn with nothing when they leave after dying or they join for the first time.
- Fixed a bug where weapon attachments and ammo didn’t save inside of small storage chests.
- Fixed a bug where containers didn’t have items until after the first respawn.
- Fixed a bug where players would spawn before they had completely loaded.
- Fixed a bug where building placements went in the wrong spot once placed.
- Fixed a bug where dropping an item that was in use would break all item use.

- Fixed a bug where doors would be in the wrong spot when the server restarted while they were opened.
- Fixed a bug where the combat timer was incorrectly set to 30 instead of 60 when actually hitting a player with a bullet. 30 seconds should be the “near-miss” combat timer.
- Fixed a bug where the camera would clip through or partially into objects that were very close to it or your character.
- Fixed a bug where tooltips would not display correctly when moving your mouse between slots and other UI.
- Fixed a bug where cars could run on no fuel and would be silent.

- Fixed a bug where players could switch off of a grenade before throwing it and it would still throw the grenade.
- Fixed a bug where the /graphics command wasn’t working.
- Fixed a bug where players could block interactions causing players to close container interactions.
- Fixed a bug where corpses would occasionally be unlootable.
- Minor bug fixes.
